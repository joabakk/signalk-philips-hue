Signal K Node Server Plugin To Operate Hue Lights

This plugin can control Hue lights on the local network. 

If your boat does not have internet access, you'll need to enter the ip address of your Hue Bridge in the plugin configuration.

Before enabling the plugin, press the "Link" button on your hue bridge. 

I have not yet really figured out the hue/saturation values, so these may change in the future.
